# LLVM
## Hello world in LLVM programming language

### LLVM Is a set of compiler and toolchain technologies that can be used to develop a frontend for any programming language and a backend for any instruction set architecture.

### LLVM is designed around a language-independent intermediate representation (IR) that serves as a portable, high-level assembly language that can be optimized with a variety of transformations over multiple passes.
