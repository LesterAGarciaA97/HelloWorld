# Labyrinth
## Hello world in Labyrinth programming language

### Labyrinth is a two-dimensional stack-based programming language developed by user:Martin Ender.

### The source code resembles a maze which is traversed by the instruction pointer. Labyrinth has two main features setting it apart from most other languages: a) there are no control flow operators - control flow is determined solely by the layout of the maze - and b) the source code can be modified at runtime via cyclic shifts of rows and columns.
