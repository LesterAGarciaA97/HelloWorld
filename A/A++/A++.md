# A++
## Hello world in A++ programming language

### A++ stands for "A bstraction" PLUS "Reference" PLUS "Synthesis", which is used as a name for the minimalist programming language that is based on ARS. ARS is an abstraction of the lambda calculus, taking its three basic operations and giving it more general meaning while providing a foundation for the three main programming paradigms: functinal programming, object-oriented programming and imperative programming.

### ARS-based programming is the same given to programming that consists mainly on the application of ARS-derived patterns to programming in any language.
