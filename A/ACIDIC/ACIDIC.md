# ACIDIC
## Hello world in ACIDIC programming language

### ACIDIC is a esoteric programming language or "esolang", is a computer programming language designed to experiment with weird ideas to be hard to program in or just as a joke rather than a practical use as other programming languages.

### There are many reasons for creating an esoteric programming language, possibly most indicative of an esolang is that the language is not designed for serious functionality.

### The most important characteristic of this programming language is designed to have as few instructions as possible.
