# Idris
## Hello world in Idris programming language

### Idris is a programming language designed to encourage Type-Driven Development.
### In type-driven development, types are tools for constructing programs. We treat types as the plan for a program, and use the compiler and type checker as our assistant, guiding us to complete program that satisfies the type. The more expressive the type is that we give up front, the more confidence we can have that the resulting program will be correct.
