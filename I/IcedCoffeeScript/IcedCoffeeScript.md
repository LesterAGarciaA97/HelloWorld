# IcedCoffeeScript
## Hello world in IcedCoffeeScript programming language

### IcedCoffeeScript is a superset of CoffeeScript. The iced interpreter is a drop-in replacement for the standard coffee interpreter; it will interpret almost all existing CoffeeScript programs.
### IcedCoffeeScript (ICS) adds two new keywords: await and defer. These additions simply and powerfully streamline asynchronous control flow, both on the server and on the browser. Say goodbye to callback pyramids; say adios to massive code rewrites when synchronization requirements change slightly.
