# Oxygene
## Hello world in Oxygene programming language

### Oxygene is a programming language developed by RemObjects Software for Microsoft’s Common Language Infrastructure, the Java Platform and Cocoa. Oxygene is based on Delphi’s Object Pascal, but also has influences from C#, Eiffel, Java, F# and other languages.

### Compared to the now deprecated Delphi.NET, Oxygene does not emphasize total backward compatibility, but is designed to be a “reinvention” of the language, be a good citizen on the managed development platforms, and leverage all the features and technologies provided by the .NET and Java runtimes.
