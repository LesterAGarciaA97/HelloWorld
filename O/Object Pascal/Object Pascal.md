# Object Pascal
## Hello world in Object Pascal programming language

### Object Pascal is an extension to the programming language Pascal that provides object-oriented programming (OOP) features such as classes and methods.

### The language was originally developed by Apple Computer as Clascal for the Lisa Workshop development system. As Lisa gave way to Macintosh, Apple collaborated with Niklaus Wirth, the author of Pascal, to develop an officially standardized version of Clascal. This was renamed Object Pascal.

###Through the mid-1980s, Object Pascal was the main programming language for early versions of the MacApp application framework.
