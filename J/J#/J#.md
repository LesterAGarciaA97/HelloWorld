# J#
## Hello world in J# programming language

### J# pronounced J sharp, is Microsoft's implementation of Java with new concepts and a different flavor.

### It is very important to be aware that, although the codes of Java and J# on screen appear sometimes the same, both languages have a lot of differences and should not be considered the same. Neither Sun (the initiator and main, but not the only one, publisher of Java) nor Microsoft (the only publisher, at the time of this writing, of J#) made any effort or pretension to have both languages compatible (and in my opinion, it should never be an issue for you).

### The goal of J# is to make sure that people who program in Java can use it to write applications using the Microsoft .NET Framework, whether applications are GUI applications for the MS Windows, web-based applications, communication software, etc. J# allows Java developers to enjoy the same ease and friendly environment as Visual Basic .NET or Microsoft C# programmers.
