# Jolie
## Hello world in Jolie programming language

### Jolie is a contract-first programming language, which puts API design at the forefront. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication. Data models are defined by types that support refinement (in red on the right), and DTO (Data Transfer Objects) transformations are transparently managed by the interpreter

### Jolie crystallises the programming concepts of service-oriented computing as linguistic constructs. The basic building blocks of software are not objects or functions, but rather services that can be relocated and replicated as needed. A composition of services is a service.
