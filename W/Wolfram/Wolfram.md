# Wolfram
## Hello world in Wolfram programming language

### The Wolfram Language is a symbolic language, intentionally designed with the scale and drive necessary to develop advanced programs quickly. By integrating high-level shapes, such as Image, GeoPolygon, or Molecule, along with advanced superfunctions such as ImageIdentify or ApplyReaction, the Wolfram Language makes it possible to quickly express complex ideas computationally.
