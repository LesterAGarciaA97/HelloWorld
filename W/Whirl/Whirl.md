# Whirl
## Hello world in Whirl programming language

### Whirl programming language has only two instructions: 0 and 1. While the Whirl Team was tempted to build a compiler that converted text source files of 0s and 1s into very small binary files with a sequence of 0/1 bits, the idea was thwarted at the last minute by a sudden attack of laziness. Maybe it'll happen later on when Whirl becomes adopted by the enterprise market to replace the aging Java platform.
