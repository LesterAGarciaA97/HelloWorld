# Wyvern
## Hello world in Wyvern programming language

### Wyvern is a new programming language designed to help developers be highly productive when writing high-assurance applications. The first major innovation in Wyvern is type-specific languages, a feature that allows programmers to create literals of a given type (e.g. a SQLQuery type) in a language appropriate to that type (e.g. SQL). We are currently working on the Wyvern object model and on providing architects with more architectural control.
