# Whenever
## Hello world in Whenever programming language

### Whenever is an esoteric programming language by David Morgan-Mar, with no sense of urgency. The program code is like a to-do list: the interpreter is free to execute statements in any order it chooses. However, a line may contain a clause specifying that it cannot be executed until certain conditions are true. There are no control flow structures or variables.
