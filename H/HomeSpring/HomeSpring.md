# HomeSpring
## Hello world in HomeSpring programming language

### HomeSpring, alternateviley HOtMEfSPRIbNG, is a high-level esoteric programming language created by Jeff Binder in 2003 with the express intention of being far higher level than anyone would ever reasonably need or want.
### Programs define a map of data control segments through which data flows sequentially and deterministically, and all commands are based on a metaphor of salmon travelling upriver.
### Each datum is an object consisting of a character string called the "name" and a boolean called the "age" of the datum. Three classes of command can change the value of data (name or age), the behavior of each datum (this behavior can be fixed or vary based on each datum), and the whole of the map on which the data flow.
