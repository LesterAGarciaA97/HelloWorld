# ParaSail
## Hello world in ParaSail programming language

### ParaSail is a new parallel programming language designed to support the development of inherently safe and secure, highly parallel applications that can be mapped to multicore, manycore, heterogeneous, or distributed architectures.

### Javallel and Parython are versions of the ParaSail technology adapted for Java and Python. (Thanks to Abouzar Abassi for elegant new ParaSail logo.)
