# Pluvo
## Hello world in Pluvo programming language

### Pluvo is a functional and imperative programming language intended to be highly practical for scripting and CGIs, interpreted using a just-in-time compiler. Its hybrid dynamic and strict typing is flexible enough to allow duck typing. Its functions are, more specifically, closures, and it allows object orientation using prototypes.

### Apart from Strings, Numbers, URIs, Regexps, and other such atoms, its most important datatype is the Table, which is an array and hashtable hybrid Ã  la Javascript and Lua (from which it gets its name).
