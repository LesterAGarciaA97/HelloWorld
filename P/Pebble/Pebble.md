# Pebble
## Hello world in Pebble programming language

### Pebble is an open source interpreted scripting language designed to explore how syntax and programming primitives can be reimagined in a more familiar, human friendly way. Our mission is to create a language that is easy to pick up, straightforward to learn, and expressive enough to be impactful.

### Achieving these goals involves finding innovative solutions to reduce syntax constraints and designing novel ways to think about coding primitives.
