# Neko
## Hello world in Neko programming language

### Neko is a high-level dynamically typed programming language developed by Nicolas Cannasse as part of research and development (R&D) efforts at two indie video game.

### Neko has a compiler and a virtual machine (VM) with garbage collection. The compiler converts a source .neko file into a bytecode .n file that can be executed with the VM. 


### Since Neko is dynamically typed with no fixed classes, a developer only needs to find the proper runtime mapping (in contrast to type mapping) so that code executes correctly.
