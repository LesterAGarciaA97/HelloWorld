## Hello world in Nial programming language

### Nial (Nested Interactive Array Language) is a general purpose programming language based on a formal model of Arrays developed by Trenchard More and Michael Jenkins.

### Nial is part of the APL family of programming languages, with the philosophy that the best design could come from a combination of both functional and imperative styles in an array language. It differs from standard APL in that it offers a more traditional programming language syntax.
