# NXC
## Hello world in NXC programming language

### NXC is a simple language for programming the LEGO MINDSTORMS NXT product. The NXT has a bytecode interpreter (provided by LEGO), which can be used to execute programs. 


### The NXC compiler translates a source program into NXT bytecodes, which can then be executed on the target itself. Although the preprocessor and control structures of NXC are very similar to C, NXC is not a general-purpose programming language - there are many restrictions that stem from limitations of the NXT bytecode interpreter.
