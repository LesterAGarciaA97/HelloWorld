## Hello world in Gasoil programming language

### Gasoil (General Application Stack Oriented Imperative Language) is a postfix notation esoteric programming language invented in 2009.

### The main idea was to test a language (and interpreter) that insted of loading the program in a fixed memory, loads the program in a "program stack".

### This programming language is imperative, structured, recursive without a call stack or return stack, stack oriented, full postfix and reflection oriented.
