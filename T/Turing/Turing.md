# Turing
## Hello world in Turing programming language

### Turing is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed in 1982 by Ric Holt and James Cordy, at University of Toronto in Ontario, Canada.

### It was designed in order to help students taking their first computer science course learn how to code. Turing is a descendant of Pascal, Euclid, and SP/k that features a clean syntax and precise machine-independent semantics.
