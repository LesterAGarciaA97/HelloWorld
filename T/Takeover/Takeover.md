# Takeover
## Hello world in Takeover programming language

### Takeover is an esoteric programming language created by User:ais523 in 2016. The original idea that inspired the language was to create a language in which standard input was appended to the program before it started to execute (thus making the null program a self-interpreter), and the rest of the language was designed around this concept.

### The resulting language has some similarities to Splinter, and some similarities to the non-esoteric language Forth.
