## Hello world in TapeBagel programming language

### TapeBagel is an esoteric programming language that uses an integer array of three integers to make up most of the commands and operators. It was made by S. R. Farmer in May, 2006, a full time SDK is currently in the works. The commands and operators consist of two to seven special characters such as the pound sign etc.

### The first character or set of characters tells which class the operator is in. The second character or set of characters will have another character telling which command or operator in that class.
