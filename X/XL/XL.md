# XL
## Hello world in XL programming language

### XL is an extensible programming language, designed to accomodate a variety of programming needs with ease.

### Being extensible means that the language is designed to make it very easy for programmers to adapt the language to suit their needs, for example by adding new programming constructs. In XL, extending the language is a routine and safe operation, much like adding a function or creating a class in more traditional programming languages. This extensibility is demonstrated by the fact that operations that are built-in in other programming languages, such as integer arithmetic, basic types or loops, are part of the standard library in XL.
