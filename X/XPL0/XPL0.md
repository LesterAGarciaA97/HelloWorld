# XPL0
## Hello world in XPL0 programming language

### XPL0 is essentially a cross between Pascal and C. It looks somewhat like Pascal but works more like C. It was originally created in 1976 by Peter J. R. Boyle, who designed it to run on a 6502 microprocessor as an alternative to BASIC. The story surrounding its early history is here.

### Although XPL0 stands for eXperimental Programming Language level Zero, it's well beyond the experimental stage and, hopefully, is regarded as well beyond level zero. The name is kept for historical reasons. The language is based on PL/0, Niklaus Wirth's example compiler in his book "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs." Over the years, versions of XPL0 have been ported to many different computers. The programs provided on this site are mostly for IBM-compatible PCs. They all run under DOS, and DOSBox for modern Windows computers.
