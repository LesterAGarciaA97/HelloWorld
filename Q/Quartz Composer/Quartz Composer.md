# Quartz Composer
## Hello world in Quartz Composer programming language

### Quartz Composer is a node-based visual programming language provided as part of the Xcode development environment in macOS for processing and rendering graphical data.

### Quartz Composer uses OpenGL (including GLSL), OpenCL (only in Mac OS X Snow Leopard and later), Core Image, Core Video, JavaScript, and other technologies to create an API and a developer tool around a simple visual programming paradigm. Apple has embedded Quartz technologies deeply into the operating system.
