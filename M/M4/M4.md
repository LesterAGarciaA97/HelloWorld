## Hello world in M4 programming language

### M4 is a general-purpose macro processor included in most Unix-like operating systems, and is a component of the POSIX standard.

### The language was designed by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie for the original versions of UNIX. It is an extension of an earlier macro processor, m3, written by Ritchie for an unknown AP-3 minicomputer.
