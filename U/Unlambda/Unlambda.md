# Unlambda
## Hello world in Unlambda programming language

### Unlambda, designed by David Madore in 1999, is a minimal functional esoteric programming language based on combinatory logic. Notably, it was the first functional paradigm Turing tarpit.

### Unlambda is written in a parenthesis-free prefix notation; parentheses are neither necessary nor allowed. Instead, the ` prefix operator is used to apply a function to an argument; if f and x are expressions, then `fx is an expression that applies f to the argument x. Other than this operator, every other element of the language is essentially a combinator, denoting a function taking exactly one other function as argument and returning another.
