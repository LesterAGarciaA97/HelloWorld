# Ubercode
## Hello world in Ubercode programming language

### Ubercode is a high level programming language designed by Ubercode Software and released in 2005 for Microsoft Windows. Ubercode is influenced by Eiffel and BASIC.

### It is proprietary software and can be tried out for free for 30 days. Ubercode has the following design goals: Compilable language—compiled into Windows EXE files. Automatic memory management—memory is allocated / freed automatically, and the language has no memory management primitives. Pre and post conditions—these are run-time assertions which are attached to function declarations, as in Eiffel. High-level data types—resizable arrays, lists and tables may contain arbitrary components. Integrated file handling—primitives for transparent handling of text, binary, CSV, XML and dBase files. Ease of use—language structure is relatively simple, making the language accessible to.beginners.
