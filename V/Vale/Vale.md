# Vale
## Hello world in Vale programming language

### Vale is AOT compiled to LLVM, statically-typed, and uses the new generational references technique for memory safety with speed and flexibility, and will soon have region borrow checking to make it even faster.

### It is the safest native language, thanks to generational references and Fearless FFI.

### Vale has memory-safe single ownership without garbage collection or a borrow checker, which makes it easy to write safe, fast code.
