# Verilog
## Hello world in Verilog programming language

### Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) that is used to describe digital systems and circuits in the form of code. It was developed by Gateway Design Automation in the mid-1980s and later acquired by Cadence Design Systems.

### Verilog is widely used for design and verification of digital and mixed-signal systems, including both application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
