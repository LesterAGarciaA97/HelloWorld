# COW
## Hello world in COW programming language

### COW is an esoteric programming language created by Sean Herber in 2003.

### It is a Brainfuck variant designed humorously with bovinae in mine.

### COW has twelve instructions (four more than Brainfuck) and is Turing-complete.

### Most instructions are "moos", only the capitalization varies: mOo, moO, mOO, Moo.
