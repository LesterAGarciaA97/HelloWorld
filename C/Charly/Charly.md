# Charly
## Hello world in Charly programming language

### harly is a dynamically typed and object-oriented programming language. The syntax is mostly inspired by languages like JavaScript or Ruby, but offers more freedom when writing. The first difference one might notice is the absence of semicolons or the missing need for parenthesis in most of the languages control structures. Charly, as it is right now, is just a toy language written in spare time.
