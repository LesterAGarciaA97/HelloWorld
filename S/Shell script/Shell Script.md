## Hello world in Shell Script programming language

### Shell script is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter.

### The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text. A script which sets up the environment, runs the program, and does any necessary cleanup or logging, is called a wrapper.
