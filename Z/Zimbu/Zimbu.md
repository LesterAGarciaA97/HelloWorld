# Zimbu
## Hello world in Zimbu shell programming language

### Zimbu is an experimental programming language that combines the nice features of Java, Python, Ruby, and other languages and throws in a few brand-new ideas. It is compact, without being obscure. It runs on any system with a C compiler.

### Zimbu is designed to be easy to learn and use, while still being powerful enough for serious programming tasks. It has a clean and concise syntax that is similar to Python, but with some Java-style features such as static typing and interfaces. Zimbu also supports functional programming, with features such as lambda expressions and closures.


### Zimbu is still under development, but it has already been used to create a variety of applications, including a web server, a game engine, and a text editor. It is a promising new language that is worth keeping an eye on.
