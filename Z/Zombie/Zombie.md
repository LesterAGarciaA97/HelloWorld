## Hello world in Zombie shell programming language

### ZOMBIE stands for Zombie-Oriented Machine-Being Interface Engine and was designed for necromancers, particularly evil ones.

### Programs are run in a multithreaded environment where every kind of entity (zombie, vampire, ghost, demon or djinn) acts in a slightly different way. A program is a list of entity declarations stating the action that each entity must perform.
