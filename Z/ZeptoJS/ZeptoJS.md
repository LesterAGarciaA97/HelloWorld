# ZeptoJS
## Hello world in ZeptoJS shell programming language

### Zepto, as the title spoiled it for you, is a mobile JavaScript framework that rectifies both of the issues mentioned above. It has a very small code base and is feather weight at around 8kb.

### It manages to be so svelte by mostly cutting out the cross browser stuff. When it was created, the main focus was to support Webkit only. The mobile version of Webkit to be exact. Now, it's been expanded to work with desktop browsers too -- but only modern ones. No more klutzing around to make things work this IE6!
