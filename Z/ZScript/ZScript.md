# ZScript
## Hello world in ZScript shell programming language

### ZScript (formerly known as DoomScript) is a text-based lump used to create classes, structs, and custom functionality for use in ZDoom. It is similar to Java and C# in many ways and allows for more advanced control of all gameplay facets (Actors, levels, game modes, etc.) than DECORATE does.
